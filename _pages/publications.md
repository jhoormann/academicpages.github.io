# Analysis Contributions

## CIV Black Hole Mass Measurements with the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES)
[Hoormann et al 2019, submitted to MNRAS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190204206H)

By measuring how long it takes for light to echo around the supermassive black holes found in the centers of active galaxies it is possible to measure the mass of the black hole.  Using the data from the OzDES Reverberation Mapping Program we measured the mass of two distant black holes to be over a billion times more massive than our sun!

## Quasar Accretion Disk Sizes from Continuum Reverberation Mapping in the DES Standard Star Fields
[Yu et al 2018, submitted to ApJ](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181103638Y)

It is possible to measure the sizes of black hole acretion disks by looking at the difference in light travel times from the hot emission from close to the black hole versus colder emission from the edge of the disk.  We measured the disk size of 23 objects observed with DES and find that the disk sizess are generally consistent with the most popular theoretical model.

# Data Contributions

## First Cosmology Results Using Type Ia Supernova From the Dark Energy Survey: Simulations to Correct Supernova Distance Biases
[Kessler et al 2019, MNRAS 485:1171](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.1171K)

The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is using observations of Type Ia supernova to study the accelerated expansion of the universe.  If the observations of the distances to the supernova are biased in any way this can alter the results of the cosmology analysis.  This paper did simulations to determine the potential biases in the distance measurements and these results can be used to correct the observed data.

## First Cosmology Results Using Type Ia Supernova From the Dark Energy Survey: Constraints on Cosmological Parameters
[Abbott et al 2019, ApJL 872:2](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...872L..30A)

The accelerated expansion of the universe is caused by a still largley understood quantity called Dark Energy.  This paper presents DES's measurement of the dark energy equation of state.

## Rapidly Evolving Transients in the Dark Energy Survey
[Pursiainen et al 2018, MNRAS 481:894](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481..894P)

The Dark Energy Supernova Program has observed many objects that vary in brightness significantly over short periods of time.  This paper looks into what what these objects could be, the best option is galaxies that are currently forming stars.

## First Cosmology Results Using Type Ia Supernova From the Dark Energy Survey: Survey Overview and Supernova Spectroscopy
[D'Andrea et al 2018, submitted to AJ](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181109565D)

This paper overviews the DES Supernova Program which uses photometric and spectroscopic data to study the expansion of the unvierse using Type Ia supernova.

## First Cosmology Results Using Type Ia Supernova From the Dark Energy Survey: Effects of Chromatic Corrections to Supernova Photometry on Measurements of Cosmological Parameters
[Lasker et al 2018, submitted to MNRAS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181102380L)

In order to study cosmology with Type Ia supernova high precision photometric data is needed across various color filters.  This paper focuses on how to best calibrate the photometric data and how those corrections vary depending on the filter used.

## First Cosmology Results Using Type Ia Supernova From the Dark Energy Survey: Analysis, Systematic Uncertanties, and Validation
[Brout et al 2018, submitted to ApJ](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181102377B)

Here the analysis of 207 supernova obtained from the first 3 years of the DES supernova program are presented.  A comprehensive study of the systematic uncertanties are presented which now become important given the high caliber photometric data.  

## First Cosmology Results Using Type Ia Supernova From the Dark Energy Survey: Measurement of the Hubble Constant
[Macaulay et al 2018, submitted to MNRAS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181102376M)

This paper combines Type Ia supernova observations made with by DES, existing supernova data, and measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations to determine the expansion rate of the universe.

## Cosmological Constraints from Multiple Probes in the Dark Energy Survey
[Abbott et al 2018, arXiv:1811.02375](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181102375D)

This research confirms the existence of dark energy by combining data from four different cosmological probes - type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillations, weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clustering - all measured by the Dark Energy Survey.

## First Cosmology Results Using Type Ia Supernova From the Dark Energy Survey: Constraints on Cosmological Parameters
[Abbott et al 2018, arXiv:1811:02374](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181102374D)

Here the results from the first 3 years of the DES supernova program along with other cosmological probes in order to measure the dark energy equation of state and matter density of the universe.

## DES Science Portal: Computing Photometric Redshifts
[Gschwend et al 2018, A&C 25:58](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....25...58G)

A web based data interface, the Science Portal, was created to train and validate methods to determine photometric redshifts.  Here it is shown how the Science Portal can be used on the first year of DES data.

#### What is with these crazy long author list?
If you have clicked on the links to the papers you will have seen that many of these papers have very long author lists. You may be wondering how exactly 50+ people contributed to a 15 page paper. This is something that is quite common in observational astronomy research.  Many of the surveys like the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) are made up of large collaborations of people.  In order to run they require extensive work from the community.  These are infrastructure tasks such as building the instruements, doing the observing, performing data analysis, maintaining the database, etc.  Like any other academic field the old adage "publish or perish" is true in astronomy as well.   While critically important to getting the data necessary to do the cool science these are often tasks that don't result in publications of their own.  In DES and OzDES the builder system is designed to recognize those who have spent a significant amount of time on the infrastructure of the survey by allowing them to gain authorship on papers that use the survey's data.  Other surveys have similar systems.  I am an OzDES builder.  I gained this status through regularly going to the telescope to observe, running the weekly telecons, and maintaining the record of everyone in the collaboration's contribution to the survey.  This means that I am allowed to be an author on any paper that directly uses data taken by OzDES.  Generally those who directly contributed to the analysis of the paper are first on the author list and then all the builders are listed (in alphabetical order).  For papers presenting the key science results from the survey the entire author list is typically alphabetical.
