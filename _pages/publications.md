## CIV Black Hole Mass Measurements with the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES)
[Hoormann et al 2019,submitted to MNRAS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190204206H)

By measuring how long it takes for light to echo around the supermassive black holes found in the centers of active galaxies it is possible to measure the mass of the black hole.  Using the data from the OzDES Reverberation Mapping Program we measured the mass of two distant black holes to be over a billion times more massive than our sun!

#### What is with these crazy long author list?
If you have clicked on the links to the papers you will have seen that many of these papers have very long author lists. You may be wondering how exactly 50+ people contributed to a 15 page paper. This is something that is quite common in observational astronomy research.  Many of the surveys like the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) are made up of large collaborations of people.  In order to run they require extensive work from the community.  These are infrastructure tasks such as building the instruements, doing the observing, performing data analysis, maintaining the database, etc.  Like any other academic field the old adage "publish or perish" is true in astronomy as well.   While critically important to getting the data necessary to do the cool science these are often tasks that don't result in publications of their own.  In DES and OzDES the builder system is designed to recognize those who have spent a significant amount of time on the infrastructure of the survey by allowing them to gain authorship on papers that use the survey's data.  Other surveys have similar systems.  I am an OzDES builder.  I gained this status through regularly going to the telescope to observe, running the weekly telecons, and maintaining the record of everyone in the collaboration's contribution to the survey.  This means that I am allowed to be an author on any paper that directly uses data taken by OzDES.  Generally those who directly contributed to the analysis of the paper are first on the author list and then all the builders are listed (in alphabetical order).
