#H1 Objectives
The past several years I have worked as an astrophysicist using both numerical simulations and observational data to understand how gravity behaves in the extreme environments found around black holes.  I am looking to utilize my skills at taking large, messy data sets and extracting truths about the universe to more local problems as a data scientist.
