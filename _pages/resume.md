# Education
* PhD in Physics – Washington University in St. Louis, August 2016
* AM in Physics – Washington University in St. Louis, May 2014
* BS in Astrophysics and Mathematics – Baylor University, May 2012

# Employment
## Postdoctoral Research Fellow – University of Queensland, August 2016 – August 2019
### Scientific Objectives
* Used observational data from the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) Reverberation Mapping Program to measure the mass of the supermassive black holes in the centers of distant galaxies in order to study how galaxies and black holes have changed throughout the history of the universe.

### Key Contributions
* Developed the data calibration procedures critical to the project to correct the data taken on the Anglo-Australian Telescope to compensate for noise due to observational conditions.
* Developed the data analysis pipeline to extract the key measurements and corresponding uncertainties from the telescope data.
* Performed a time series analysis using the results of the analysis pipeline in order to measure black hole masses 

### Professional Outcomes
*	Chief-Investigator of a successful proposal for supercomputing time through National Computational Infrastructure Australia.
*	Co-Investigator of 2 successful proposals for telescope time through the National Optical Astronomy Observatory.
*	Author on 16 journal articles and spoke at 6 conferences/universities to present results.

### Teamwork/Managment
* Lead the OzDES Reverberation Mapping working group including approximately 10 people across the USA and Australia
*	Supervised 3 honours level (comparable to a MS degree) students
*	Primary supervisor for a PhD student
*	Member of the Local Organizing Committee for 2 conferences
*	Member of the OzDES Policy and Membership Committee responsible for recruiting observers to operate the telescope and perform the preliminary data analysis. Maintained the work load record to ensure appropriate allocation of credit on results published using the data.
*	Guest lecturer for the second year astronomy course

## Graduate Research Fellow – Washington University in St. Louis, June 2012 – July 2016
### Scientific Objectives
* Determine if it is possible to test Albert Einstein’s theory of General Relativity in the extreme environments using X-ray observations of black holes.
*	Build a balloon-borne X-ray polarimeter, X-Calibur, predict how well such observations could be used to study the environments surrounding black holes.

### Key Contributions
*	Utilized and expanded upon numerical simulations to predict the signatures that would be observable from around black holes assuming different theories of gravity.
*	Constrained how well X-ray observations of black holes could test Einstein’s theory of General Relativity
*	Performed the predictive analysis the ability of a proposed NASA satellite mission to use X-ray polarization to study black holes. 
*	Performed critical analysis of the telescope design of the balloon borne X-ray polarimeter, X-Calibur, to determine how it would behave in extreme temperatures and used those results to provide the solution to ensure the telescope would operate in flight.

### Professional Outcomes
*	Authored 4 journal articles and spoke at 4 conferences/universities to present results.

### Teamwork/Managment
*	Supervised 2 summer research students
*	Taught introductory physics labs
*	Co-Organizer for a special session on black hole accretion at the American Astronomical Society’s Annual High Energy Astrophysics Division Meeting 2016
*	Co-Organizor of a workshop in numerical astrophysics
